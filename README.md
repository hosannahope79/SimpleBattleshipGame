"# SimpleBattleshipGame" 

This is a very simplified version of the game battleship. First, a board is constructed that consists of a 5x5 grid of "O"s. The instructions are printed for the user. Then, a random row and column is chosen to be the correct spot where the battleship is hidden. Each turn, the user is prompted to enter a row and column number as their guess. If the user chooses the correct spot, a message is printed saying, "Congratulations! You sunk my battlship!" If they enter row or column numbers that are not on the board, a message is printed that says "Oops, that's not even in the ocean." If they enter a number they have already guessed, a message is printed saying "You guessed that one already." Otherwise, the code prints "You missed my battleship!" The user gets 4 chances to guess where the battleship is before the game is over.
